Magic Lantern Core Math Library

The Magic Lantern Software Development Kit provides a library of math utilities to facilitate title development.
The math library contains classes for vectors with 2, 3 and 4 floating-point elements. The library also provides
a 4x3 affine matrix of floating-point elements. The Math Library from the Magic Lantern project provides both
floating-point and fixed-point utility.

Instructions for generating the API documentation can be found on the [Math Library wiki](https://github.com/magic-lantern-studio/mle-documentation/wiki/Math-Library) page captured in the [mle-documentation Github project](https://github.com/magic-lantern-studio/mle-documentation).
